2. Calculates statistics related to the dataset, such as:
   - Count of each race represented.
   - Average age of men.
   - Percentage of people with a Bachelor's degree.
   - Percentage of people with advanced education making more than 50K.
   - Minimum number of hours a person works per week.
   - Percentage of people with minimum work hours making more than 50K.
   - Country with the highest percentage of rich individuals.
   - Most popular occupation for those who earn >50K in India.

3. Rounds the calculated decimals to the nearest tenth.

4. Optionally, prints the calculated statistics.
